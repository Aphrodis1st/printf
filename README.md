# printf project
Printf is a project where 2 people pair up for the same project. This project is done in 5 days. We had different google meet sessions to explain to us how it will be done to avoid mistakes and troubles. Plagiarism immediately causes a 0 mark, to mean that it's not allowed. We have to work together, share ideas, and make decisions together to prevent misunderstandings.
